  ### Driving Language ###
  ########################

The driving language is the protocol of datas sent by network from the driving WS to the targeted device (Arduino). The language is a sequence of commands that the Arduino will execute on the PlayStation remote control. The sequence of commands is, at an http level, a sequence of characters, which meaning are the followings:

. '{' = Starts a sequence sending so that every characters following are considered as interpreted as driving language characters by the Arduino device.


. 'U' = "Up" -> to push the "Up" button of the PS  remote control.

. 'D' = "Down" -> to push the "Down" button of the PS  remote control.

. 'L' = "Left" -> to push the "Left" button of the PS  remote control.

. 'R' = "Right" -> to push the "Right" button of the PS  remote control.

. 'X' = to push the "X" button of the PS remote control. This button semantic is to do a selection.

. 'O' = to push the "O" button of the PS remote control. This button semantic is to cancel a selection of just go back.

. 'H' = "Home" -> to push the Home button of the Playstation. Also known as the 'PS' button.


. 'P' = "Power TV" -> to push the power TV button


. 'S' = "Sleep" -> a special command to tell the Arduino device to sleep. 'Seconds amount' must be provided as 'S,n' , with n = the amount of sleeping seconds.

. 'K' = "Kill" -> tell the Arduino device to Shutdown itself.

. '-' = the separator between each "button push" command.


. '}' = Close the command sequence. After this character, the Arduino device is supposed to stop reading the next bytes of the http connection (it can be closed).
